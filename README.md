# CS-217

This is my repository for CS-217 Object Oriented Programming (C++)


This course focuses on problem solving using advanced programming skills. Pointers, linked lists, and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts will be explored throughout. This course also introduces the Big - O asymptotic notation to measure the efficiency of algorithms. Special emphasis will be given to introduce basic linear and binary searching and bubble, selection, and insertion sorting algorithms.
